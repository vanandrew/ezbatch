# Getting Started

## Installation

To install `ezbatch` from PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install ezbatch
```

## AWS credentials and Configuration

First, you need to set up your AWS credentials. There are many ways to do this, so we recommend following the
[official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

Once your credentials are setup, you need to make sure the you have the correct permissions to run AWS Batch jobs.
The following sections describe how to set up the necessary permissions.
