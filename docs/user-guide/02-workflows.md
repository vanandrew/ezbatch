# Workflows and Jobs

## Overview

In `ezbatch`, a *job* is a basic unit of work that can be run on AWS Batch.
A *job* is defined by a Docker container image to run, as well as the resources required to run the *job*.

A *workflow* is a collection of jobs that depend on each other and can be set to run in a specific order. 
A *workflow* contains a list of jobs and the dependencies between them.
